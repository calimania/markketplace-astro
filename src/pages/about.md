**Welcome to **Markket.Place**, an ecosystem built by artists, for artists.**

We believe in empowering creators to manage their own storefronts, subscriptions, payments, and content.

## What We Do

Markket.Place is an ecosystem of open-source tools designed to give you full control over
your online presence.

Our goal is simple: provide artists, musicians, producers,
and creatives with the tools they need to build their own stores, connect with
their audiences, and monetize their work.

Whether you’re selling physical products, offering services, or creating digital content like subscriptions and memberships, our platform is being built to help you grow and thrive in the creative economy.

## Open source & Community driven

At Markket.Place, we embrace transparency and community-driven development.

We’ve built our platform using trusted open-source technologies like
**Strapi**, **Stripe**, and **Digital Ocean** to ensure scalability, privacy, and security.

We're committed to listening to our users and building alongside them. Our code is available to the public, and we invite feedback and contributions to create a more inclusive and participatory community.

## Privacy & Security

We take your privacy seriously. Using industry-standard technologies, our platform ensures that your data is protected at all times. From secure payments through **Stripe** to reliable hosting on **Digital Ocean**, you can trust that your transactions and information are in good hands.

## A Community of Creators

The founders of Markket.Place come from diverse backgrounds—artists, chaos magicians, engineers, startup builders, producers, and musicians. We’ve crafted this platform with an understanding of what it means to be a creator in today’s digital age. Our community thrives on creativity, collaboration, and a shared vision of an equitable space for all.

## Join Us

We believe that every creator deserves a platform that evolves with them. That’s why Markket.Place is not only built for you—it's built *by* you. We’re committed to fostering a participatory culture where your voice helps shape the future of the marketplace.

Join us, start creating, and let's build something extraordinary together.

## About this template

Created by [Sat Naing](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satnaing/)

AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. I designed and crafted this based on [my personal blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog).

This theme is aimed to be accessible out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by
default and additional color schemes can also be configured.

This theme is self-documented \_ which means articles/posts in this theme can also be considered as documentations. So, see the documentation for more info.
