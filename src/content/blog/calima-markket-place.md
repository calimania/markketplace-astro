  Excited to share our progress and ideas for Calima Markket.place as we get closer to launch.
---

Hello, creators! We’re thrilled to share the progress we’ve made so far on **Markket.Place**, and what you can expect in the coming months as we get closer to opening applications to the public.

## What We’ve Been Up To

Over the past few months, we’ve been hard at work testing our APIs and refining our platform. We’re collaborating with a select group of artists in Brooklyn to create the first storefronts on Markket.Place. These early adopters have been crucial in helping us identify what’s working well and what needs improvement.

From managing product listings to handling payments and subscriber management, we hope to include the most important features expected and selecting the most trusted vendors and partners.

## What's Possible

Here’s a rundown of what can be done on Markket.Place:

- **Create and customize your own storefront**: Artists can design their own spaces, manage product listings, and showcase their work in a way that reflects their unique style.
- **Manage payments securely with Stripe**: Our integration with Stripe allows you to handle payments safely and efficiently, ensuring that both you and your customers have a seamless experience.
- **Offer subscriptions**: For those who want to build recurring revenue, our platform lets you set up and manage subscriptions, perfect for exclusive content, workshops, or monthly artwork releases.
- **Own your audience**: Your subscribers and customers are yours to connect with directly. We believe in giving creators the tools to build and nurture their communities, on your terms.
- **Newsletters & CRM integrations**: Manage your customers and marketing communications.

## What’s Next? The Roadmap

We’re still in the testing phase, but once we’re confident in the system’s stability and scalability, we’ll start to open up the platform to more artists.

- **Expand storefront features**: We’re planning to add more customization options and templates so each artist can truly make their store feel like home.
- **Collaborations and collections**: We know the power of collaboration in the creative world, so we’ll be rolling out features to support joint collections and shared storefronts.
- **Scaling the platform**: After onboarding a few more friends and artists from our network, we’ll be focusing on ensuring the platform can scale to support larger audiences without compromising performance.
- **Open applications**: Once we’ve tested everything thoroughly and are sure of the system's scalability, we’ll begin taking applications from the public. We can’t wait to see the amazing stores you all create!

Additionally, we're seeking and encouraging developer communities to adopt our APIs and create new templates and storefronts.

## Excited to Share More!

We’re incredibly excited about the future of Markket.Place and the community of artists we’re building. As we continue developing, we’ll keep you updated with more news and features, so stay tuned!

Thanks for your patience and support. We can’t wait to open our doors to more creators soon and help you bring your art to the world.
